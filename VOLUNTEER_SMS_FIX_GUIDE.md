# Volunteer SMS Notification Fix Guide

## Problem Description

After creating a volunteer on manager or admin panel, only email notifications were being sent. SMS notifications were failing, even though the payment system had working SMS functionality using Africa's Talking.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `send_volunteer_email()` function in `classes/Master.php`. This function was only sending email notifications and completely lacked SMS functionality, unlike the payment system which had comprehensive SMS support.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Master.php Class

**File:** `classes/Master.php`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Updated `send_volunteer_email()` Function

- **Before:** Only sent email notifications
- **After:** Sends both email and SMS notifications
- **New Response Format:** Returns detailed status for both email and SMS

```php
// New response format
return json_encode([
    'success' => ($email_sent || $sms_sent),
    'email_sent' => $email_sent,
    'sms_sent' => $sms_sent,
    'message' => $message
]);
```

#### B. Added `sendVolunteerEmail()` Method

- Extracted email functionality into separate method
- Maintains existing email logic
- Returns boolean success status

#### C. Added `sendVolunteerSMS()` Method

- **Africa's Talking Integration:** Uses same approach as payment system
- **Environment Variables:** Reads credentials from `$_ENV`
- **Phone Formatting:** Properly formats phone numbers (+250 prefix)
- **Template System:** Uses database SMS templates
- **Fallback Messages:** Default messages if templates not found
- **Character Limiting:** Ensures messages fit within 160 characters
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging and error management

### 2. SMS Templates

**File:** `volunteer_sms_templates.sql`

**Templates Added:**

- `volunteer_registration` - For new volunteer registrations
- `volunteer_status_update` - For status changes
- `volunteer_approved` - For approval notifications
- `volunteer_denied` - For denial notifications

**Template Variables:**

- `{firstname}` - Volunteer's first name
- `{lastname}` - Volunteer's last name
- `{email}` - Volunteer's email
- `{contact}` - Volunteer's phone number
- `{status}` - Current status (Pending/Approved/Denied)
- `{roll}` - Volunteer ID
- `{date}` - Current date

### 3. Frontend Updates

**Files Updated:**

- `admin/volunteer/manage_volunteer.php`
- `manager/volunteer/manage_volunteer.php`

**Changes:**

- Updated JavaScript to handle new response format
- Enhanced user feedback messages
- Shows both email and SMS status
- Different alert types based on success/failure

## Technical Implementation Details

### SMS Configuration

The system uses the same Africa's Talking configuration as the payment system:

```env
# Environment Variables Required
AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME=your_username
AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Phone Number Formatting

```php
// Format phone number properly (like payment system)
$phone = $volunteer_data['contact'];
if (!preg_match('/^\+/', $phone)) {
    $phone = '+250' . ltrim($phone, '0');
}
```

### Template Processing

```php
// Get SMS template from database
$template_name = $is_new ? 'volunteer_registration' : 'volunteer_status_update';
$sql = "SELECT message FROM sms_templates WHERE template_name = ? AND is_active = 1";
$stmt = $this->conn->prepare($sql);
$stmt->bind_param("s", $template_name);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

### Error Handling

```php
// Validate response like payment system does
$recipients = $response['data']->SMSMessageData->Recipients ?? [];
$success = !empty($recipients) && $recipients[0]->status === 'Success';

if ($success) {
    error_log("Volunteer SMS sent successfully to: " . $phone);
} else {
    error_log("Volunteer SMS sending failed. Response: " . json_encode($response));
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SMS templates SQL file:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < volunteer_sms_templates.sql
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Ensure these variables are set in your `.env` file:

```env
# Africa's Talking SMS Configuration
AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME=your_username
AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY=your_api_key

# SMTP Email Configuration (existing)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

### 3. Testing

Use the test file to verify functionality:

```bash
# Access the test file in browser
http://your-domain.com/test_volunteer_sms.php
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Enhanced Feedback Messages

**Before:**

```
"Volunteer saved successfully! Email notification sent."
```

**After:**

```
"Volunteer saved successfully! Email and SMS notifications sent."
"Volunteer saved successfully! Email sent, SMS failed: [error message]"
"Volunteer saved successfully! SMS sent, Email failed: [error message]"
"Volunteer saved successfully! Both email and SMS failed: [error message]"
```

### Status Tracking

The system now tracks both email and SMS delivery status, providing administrators with clear feedback about notification delivery.

## Error Handling & Logging

### Comprehensive Logging

- **Success Logs:** `"Volunteer SMS sent successfully to: [phone]"`
- **Failure Logs:** `"Volunteer SMS sending failed. Response: [json]"`
- **Error Logs:** `"Volunteer SMS error: [exception message]"`

### Graceful Degradation

- If SMS fails, email still sends
- If email fails, SMS still sends
- If both fail, user gets clear error message
- System continues to function even if notifications fail

## Testing & Verification

### Test File Features

The `test_volunteer_sms.php` file provides:

1. **Configuration Check:** Verifies environment variables
2. **Template Verification:** Shows available SMS templates
3. **Functionality Test:** Tests both registration and status update SMS
4. **Response Analysis:** Shows detailed success/failure information
5. **Setup Instructions:** Guides through configuration process

### Manual Testing

1. Create a new volunteer in admin/manager panel
2. Check for both email and SMS notifications
3. Update volunteer status
4. Verify status update notifications
5. Check error logs for any issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. SMS Not Sending

**Symptoms:** Email works, SMS fails
**Solutions:**

- Check Africa's Talking credentials in `.env`
- Verify account balance and sender ID approval
- Check phone number format
- Review error logs

#### 2. Templates Not Found

**Symptoms:** SMS sends fallback message
**Solutions:**

- Run `volunteer_sms_templates.sql`

   # Verify environment variables
   echo $AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME
   echo $AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Test SMS API:**

   ```php
   // Use test_volunteer_sms.php
   // Check response details
   ```

3. **Check Logs:**

   ```bash
   # Check error logs
   tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
   ```

4. **Verify Templates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sms_templates WHERE template_name LIKE 'volunteer_%';
   ```
